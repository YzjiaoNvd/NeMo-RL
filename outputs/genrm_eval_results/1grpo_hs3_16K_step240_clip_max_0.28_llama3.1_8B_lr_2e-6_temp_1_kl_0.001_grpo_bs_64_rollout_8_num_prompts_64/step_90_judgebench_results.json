The author provides a clear understanding of the first two cuts, which are the most important in determining the final number of square pyramids. The third cut is also described, but the author notes that it does not result in any additional pyramids. The author emphasizes that a square pyramid is a specific geometric shape that requires a square base and four triangular faces, which is not the case for the triangular prisms obtained after the first two cuts. The author concludes that there are no square pyramids, which is a well-written and well-supported conclusion. The author provides a total of 4 examples of the first two cuts, which is a good way to illustrate the process. The author also offers a good balance of the use of the top and bottom faces of the cube, which is a common mistake in similar problems.

It uses a counter to keep track of the frequency of each number in the array. Then, for each number, it calculates the number of operations needed to delete all instances of that number. The key insight is that a number can be deleted in 3 operations if there are 3 or more instances of that number, and in 1 operation if there are 2 instances of that number. The code uses this insight to calculate the total number of operations needed to delete all numbers. The code is well-written and follows the problem description.
